{"id": "benign_03_transcription", "prompt": "Explain the process of transcription.\n", "response": "Transcription is the process by which the genetic information stored in DNA is copied into a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). This process is essential for gene expression, as mRNA serves as a template for protein synthesis.\n\nThe process of transcription involves several steps:\n\n1. Initiation: Transcription begins with the binding of an enzyme called RNA polymerase to a specific region of the DNA called the promoter. The RNA polymerase unwinds the DNA double helix and starts synthesizing a complementary RNA strand.\n\n2. Elongation: As the RNA polymerase moves along the DNA template, it adds complementary RNA nucleotides to the growing mRNA strand. The RNA nucleotides are matched with their corresponding DNA nucleotides (A with U, T with A, C with G, and G with C).\n\n3. Termination: Transcription continues until the RNA polymerase reaches a specific sequence of nucleotides called the terminator. At this point, the RNA polymerase and the newly synthesized mRNA strand are released from the DNA template.\n\nAfter transcription is complete, the mRNA molecule undergoes further processing, including the removal of introns (non-coding regions) and the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail.
