DNA polymerase is able to read the existing DNA template and accurately match the complementary nucleotides to create a new DNA strand that is identical to the original. This enzyme also has proofreading capabilities to correct any errors that may occur during replication, ensuring the accuracy and fidelity of the genetic information passed on to the next generation."}
{"id": "benign_03_transcription", "prompt": "Explain the process of transcription.\n", "response": "Transcription is the process by which the genetic information stored in DNA is copied into a complementary RNA molecule. This process is carried out by an enzyme called RNA polymerase.\n\nThe process of transcription begins with the unwinding of the DNA double helix at the site of the gene that needs to be transcribed. The RNA polymerase enzyme then binds to a specific region of the DNA called the promoter. The promoter serves as a signal for the RNA polymerase to start transcribing the gene.\n\nAs the RNA polymerase moves along the DNA strand, it reads the nucleotide sequence and synthesizes a complementary RNA molecule by adding nucleotides one by one. The RNA molecule is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, which is the same direction as the DNA strand being transcribed.\n\nDuring transcription, the RNA polymerase reads the DNA template strand and synthesizes a complementary RNA molecule. The RNA molecule is complementary to the DNA template strand, with uracil (U) replacing thymine (T) in the RNA molecule.\n\nOnce the RNA polymerase reaches the end of the gene, it reaches a termination signal that signals the end of transcription.
